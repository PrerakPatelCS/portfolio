                    <p>
                        I studied Computer Science and continue to educate my self with
                        textbooks, competitive programming, or doing projects. I want to
                        build my experience with coding so I do as many coding tasks as I can.
                        I find myself learning best by implementation because different problems
                        will arise during implementation or certain design decisions need to be
                        made. My friends and I like to share our solutions to problems and critque
                        each others code. We have learned a lot from each other as we all
                        are invested in different languages and different parts of Computer Science.
                        I like to contribute to the Computer Science community or Software Engineering 
                        communities, there is a lot to learn and I like to pay it forward. Some of my 
                        interests are playing chess, poker, going to the gym, and to code review my 
                        friend's solutions to puzzles or problems.

                            is based on the Word Frequency Distribution and using that for the Jensen Shannon Distance
                            formula to measure the similarity between the two probability distributions. The lower

                        <p>
                            The EERTREE is a palindromic tree that processes a strings 
                            efficiently for a palindrome, first introduced in a research paper
                            in 2015. Each node is a palindrome, the edges are the characters 
                            you add to both sides, and the links point to the biggest 
                            palindrome that is a suffix to this palindrome. The way the 
                            site works is that when you start typing the characters get
                            fed into a data stream I made which adds the characters to the
                            EERTREE.

                        <h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are many different algorithms that have a faster runtime than
                            naive matrix multiplication. I use the strategy pattern to 
                            test all the algorithms easily. The fastest algorithm's runtime is O(n^2.3)
                            but it is just theory, Strassen's algorithm which is O(n^2.81) is the only
                            one you can implement. Because it is divide and conquer, there is a lot of over
                            head and the algorithms base case is a 2x2 matrix so the matrices may need some padding.
                            There are 3 ways to add padding, convert the matrix to a power of 2 square matrix, 
                            dynmaic padding, and dynamic peeling. Another algorithm is Strassen Winograd which
                            is a small optimization to Strassen. Interesting fact about quick select median of 
                            medians the run time complexity is O(n) but it is slower than normal quick select.

                            A play ecommerce platform to learn how to make a full stack application.
                            I learned how to use HTML, CSS, some JQuery and React with Bootstrap for the 
                            frontend. Products are loaded from a database and when you login with store all of your
                            relavent data. To get the data from the database I use Spring Boot which I 
                            host on Google Cloud Run with a Docker container. Lastly the database is 
                            a NoSQL database, MongoDB. I used postman to test out all the api endpoints.
                            When you open the site without enabling "remember me" after logining in, 
                            a guest accound is automatically made for you and stored in the local storage.

                    Winning project in a Rutgers Hackathon, the task was to make a 
                    Twitch Plays project which takes input from the twitch streaming platforms
                    chat and that would play the game. We would need to have a voting system
                    so we get the move that chat wanted most, they would vote on which square
                    to play on. Chat would be X's and the bot would be O's. We decided to
                    use a bot that picks a random spot instead of a sophisticated bot 
                    which would either win or tie every time.

                    while I was playing basketball.

                This book goes over various data strucutres and algorithms and how to implement them 
                C++. Shows you a bunch of patterns in certain problems and the algorithms
                that can tackle them, plus the time and space complexities of them.
                The implementation details focus on how to implement it with the 
                least amount of code and goes over some tricks like using negative values
                and the default natural ordering instead of making a comparator.
                There are still some advanced algorithms I haven't gotten the chance to
                implement because of the rarity of those problems.

                This book is organized with items which you can read in any order. The items
                go over the best practices for writing clean code in Java and goes over
                a bunch of idioms which can help you in any language you want. There is 
                a lot of influence from Design Patterns and the JLS(Java Language Specification).
                The reason Design Patterns is important for Java is that the whole Collections
                Library and JDK is litered with these Design Patterns so when using them
                you understand how it all works and what their design intentions where.
            </p>
            <p>
                A big reason why I wanted to read this book was because my friends usually 
                solve problems in python and they are experts at python at this point, so 
                I became the expert at Java and now my code has become very clean and I 
                can help them out when they use Java. Also my Java code has become pythonic
                enough that sometimes my code would be cleaner than their python code
                which is very hard if you think about all the boilerplate!

            <h3>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="images/Design-Patterns.jpg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                This book does not need an introduction. It goes over 23 design patterns
                for Object Oriented Programming. For each pattern it tells you the 
                problem it solves, the consequences, the implementation, and all the 
                parts that go into it like different interfaces and classes. It also 
                goes over different implementations for different needs. The implementation
                is in C++ and Smalltalk which is obsolete as far as I know. The class diagrams
                are in OMT which is also obsolete but UML is based on OMT so it is not hard 
                to understand. This book does a great job of accumulating experience in 
                OOP and simplifying it down to 23 patterns for the readers. The book came out 
                in 1995 and is still relevant today!

            <h3>Competitive Programing</h3>
            <p>
                Competitive Programming has a series of contests where you are given around 4 to 8 
                problems and you have to solve them in a time constraint of around 2 hours. 
                There are a bunch of different levels to Competitive Programming, Codeforces uses
                a scale similar to chess, an elo system. I was first introduced to this from my friends,
                at first we would do Leetcode questions and critque each others soltuions and then
                we got really good after a ton of practice. The natural progression is to move into 
                Codeforces which is much harder than Leetcode. Codeforces is so hard that a lot
                of researchers use those questions and infrastructure to test out new algorithms 
                or data structures. The new AI's are also tested on Codeforces to see how many
                questions it can solve.

            <h3>Advent of Code</h3>
            <p>
                This was a fun event, similar to an Advent calender for Christmas you
                get a new puzzle every day from December 1st to 25th. After you
                complete the first puzzle there will be a second harder puzzle.
                Around 200 thousand people participate in this and the topics range from 
                many different fields in computer science. This is a good way to 
                challenge yourself, many people do it to learn a new language.
                I did it to get better at Python, I learned new techniques
                for coding in Python and with using a dynamic typing language.
                I also learned some new algorithms like Shoelace + Pick's theorems
                for finding area of a polygon. Check out my github repo with all my solutions.

            <h3>Rosetta Code</h3>
            <p>
                I found the EERTREE data structure from practicing coding on Leetcode,
                the question "5. Longest Palindromic Substring". After not understanding it
                I black boxed it, where I only thought about what it takes in and what it outputs.
                Later I understood more and created the EERTREE Visualization. I noticed the 
                JavaScript version was not on Rosetta Code so I added it there.

                I enjoy some Poker from time to time. During Covid I used to play with my friends
                online as a means of staying connected. My skills went from very bad to winning 
                most of the money in a couple of months. You notice patterns in the ways people play
                and how to interpret the game. I don't want to give all my secrets but your understanding
                of the game is everything since there is no strategy book people go by, everyone needs
                their own developed strategy.

            <h3>Gym</h3>
            <p>
                I always try to stay healthy, so I hit the gym. I have done many different
                workout splits and tried many different excercises out. At one point I used
                to be at the gym for 3 hours a day because there were so many excercises to do.
                It is important to always have balance, I wouldn't say 3 hours was that benefitial
                but I don't regret it, it was always fun especially with my friends. I would say
                dieting would be the most important thing and when I can get back into the grind
                I know exactly what to do.
